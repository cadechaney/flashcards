# Flashcards

# Abstract:

For this project I built a game in the terminal using TDD with class to class interaction. This game will run through a series of cards that the user can answer with a given multiple choice answer. At the end, the use will see their final score as a percentage.

## How to View Your Code in Action

  Steps in order to clone and run the app:

  1. Fork the GitHub Repository [file](https://github.com/cadechaney/flashcards)
  2. After initializing git inside the directory the user wants they can now clone their forked copy to their machine
  3. Once cloned, the user can now cd into the directory, and using the 'node index.js' command in their terminal they can now open the application in their terminal.

## Context:

This is my first solo project in Mod 2 at Turing school of Software and Design. I spent approximately 12 hours on this project.

## Wins + Challenges

Challenges: I struggled in the beginning on were to even start with my functionality. Once I caught some understanding of what needed to be done I was able to carry though with the Javascript.

Wins: I found a win for this project was for me to use my resources in my cohort effectively
